Welcome! I am a researcher in the field of medical imaging, which combines Physics, Medicine and Computer Science.
I am particularly interested in machine learning applications in image analysis, and in promoting the use of medical imaging for early disease detection and treatment.  

My CV is available [here](http://www.ivankz.com/files/cv_master.pdf) (pdf).

***Current employment and affiliations:***
