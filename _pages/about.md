I am an inter-disciplinary researcher with interests that lie at the intersection of Computer science, Physics and Medicine. Currently, I am appointed as a Postdoctoral fellow at the UBC Department of Medicine, [Division of Neurology](http://neurology.med.ubc.ca), where I develop novel image analysis techniques and apply machine learning to identify promising therapies for Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

My main place of work is at the [Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health](http://www.brain.ubc.ca).
