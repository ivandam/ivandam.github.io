Welcome! I am a researcher in the field of medical imaging, which combines Physics, Medicine and Computer Science.
I am particularly interested in machine learning applications in image analysis, and in promoting the use of medical imaging for early disease detection and treatment.  

My CV is available [here](http://www.ivankz.com/files/cv_master.pdf) (pdf).

***Current employment and affiliations:***

+ Research programmer at the **BC Cancer** Research Institute

**My past notable projects include:**

+ Our study of the effect of exercise on dopamine release in the brain of Parkinson’s disease patients was selected as a “hot topic” at the 2016 Neuroscience Meeting in San Diego (Sacheli et al., “Aerobic exercise can induce dopamine release in Parkinson’s disease: [11C]Raclopride PET study”). The study used state-of-the-art image analysis techniques that were developed by our imaging group at UBC. More info about this study can be found in [this](https://www.med.ubc.ca/news/study-of-exercise-and-parkinsons-disease-yields-encouraging-results/) UBC press release, as well as in [Richmond News](http://www.richmond-news.com/news/weekly-feature/treating-parkinson-s-with-exercise-1.2302652). Also, take a look at [this](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-boxing-classes-help-people-with-parkinsons-disease-fight-back/article30732463/) relevant article in The Globe and Mail.

+ In the early days of [MetaOptima Technology](https://metaoptima.com/), together with Dr. Maryam Sadeghi and Prof. Stella Atkins we developed an image analysis engine to detect skin cancer, and a framework for visualization and mapping of skin moles in 3D on a smartphone. The analysis engine and the bodymap are available commercially as part of the [Molescope](https://molescope.com/) and [DermEngine](https://www.dermengine.com/) products, which are considered to be one of the best in the field. This work was featured in many news outlets, for example in [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/get-smart-about-melanoma), [Vancouver Sun](http://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/a-medical-microscope-to-attach-to-your-smartphone-for-skin-cancer-screening-and-other-news-from-the-world-congress-of-dermatology), [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/molescope-smartphone-talks-dermatologist-103726970.html).

+ At the University of Washington, my colleagues and I developed a new technology to purify water from micrometer-sized particulates, such as bacteria and topsoil particles (I. Klyuzhin et al, “New Method of Water Purification Based on the Particle-Exclusion Phenomenon”). The advantage of our technology was that it required very little energy to run, compared to the traditional filter-based methods. This project was brought to prominence by a news article in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14324-dirt-repelling-tube-promises-cheap-pure-water/), and picked up by several other news feeds around the world.

+ Our work on the water non-coalescence phenomenon at the University of Washington (I. Klyuzhin et al., “Persisting Water Droplets on Water Surfaces”) was featured in a [Smarter Every Day video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&feature=share). -->
